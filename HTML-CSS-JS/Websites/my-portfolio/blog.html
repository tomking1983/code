  <h1 class="entry-title">The History of Javascript</h1>
  <div class="entry-meta">
    <p><span class="author">Written by <a href="#">Tom King</a></span> <span class="date">11th Jan 2023</span></p>

      JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language that has become an essential part of web development
      since its introduction in the mid-1990s. It has been used to create interactive web pages, streamline online
      services, and create complex web applications. As the technology has evolved over the years, so too has its usage.
      Let’s take a look at the history of JavaScript and how it’s come to dominate the web development world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first version of JavaScript, known as Mocha, was created in 1995 by Netscape for use in its Navigator web
      browser. Mocha was later renamed to LiveScript, and finally, JavaScript. It was designed to be a lightweight
      scripting language that could be used to make web pages more interactive. The language was initially met with some
      resistance from web developers due to its lack of features, but it quickly gained popularity due to its ability to
      quickly prototype code and its flexibility. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        In 1996, Microsoft released its own version of JavaScript, named JScript. This was created to compete with JavaScript, but the two languages were largely compatible with each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1997, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) for standardization. This allowed different web browsers to support the same language and enabled web developers to create cross-browser compatible web applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1999, the first version of the ECMAScript standard was released. This was the first step in the evolution of JavaScript and it laid the groundwork for the language’s continued development.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2009, the fifth version of the ECMAScript standard was released. This version included a number of significant changes and improvements, such as better support for object-oriented programming and better browser compatibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2015, the sixth version of the ECMAScript standard was released. This version included a number of additional features and improvements, such as support for modules, classes, and arrow functions.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
      Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used to create interactive web pages, streamline online services, and create complex web applications. It is also supported by all major web browsers, making it easy for developers to create cross-browser compatible web applications.
    </p>

    <img class="js-logo" src="./images/blog-images/js-logo.png" alt="">

    <p>
      The history of JavaScript is an interesting one, and it’s amazing to see how far the language has come since its introduction in 1995. It has gone from a simple scripting language to a powerful, high-level programming language that is used by millions of developers around the world.

  <h1 class="entry-title">Emerging Website Technologies</h1>
  <div class="entry-meta">
    <p><span class="author">Written by <a href="#">Tom King</a></span> <span class="date">4th Jan 2023</span></p>

      The internet is constantly changing, and website technologies are no exception. Every year, new technologies are
      emerging and quickly gaining traction with developers and users alike. These technologies can make websites
      faster, more reliable, and better able to handle large amounts of data and traffic. Here are just a few of the
      emerging website technologies you should be keeping an eye on.
    </p>


    <ol>
      <li>
        Progressive Web Applications (PWAs): PWAs are mobile-friendly websites that combine the best of web and mobile
        app experiences. They deliver content quickly, even on slow networks, and can be added to the user’s home screen
        for easy access. PWAs provide users with a more app-like experience and can help increase engagement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serverless Computing: Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider dynamically
        manages the allocation of server resources. This helps reduce costs and improve scalability since the cloud
        provider is responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI can be used to optimize website performance, improve user experience, and
        provide personalized content. AI can also be used to automate mundane tasks, such as content moderation and data
        analysis. </li>
      <li>
        Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP): AMP is an open-source web component framework that allows developers to create
        fast-loading, mobile-optimized webpages. AMP can help improve page load times, which can increase user
        engagement and reduce bounce rate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blockchain: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can be used to securely store data and facilitate
        transactions. It can be used to create immutable records, verify user identities, and create digital currencies.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <p>
      These are just a few of the emerging website technologies that are worth keeping an eye on. As these technologies
      become more commonplace, they can help make websites faster, more reliable, and more engaging for users.

  <h1 class="entry-title">The importance of a properly designed website</h1>
  <div class="entry-meta">

    <p>
      The world is quickly transitioning to an online-centric environment. As such, having a properly designed and
      developed website is essential for any business or organisation that wants to succeed in the digital age.
    </p>

    <p>
      A well-crafted website can draw in potential customers, build trust and credibility, and ultimately help your
      business or organisation to grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating a website isn’t as simple as throwing some content onto a page and calling it a day. To create a website
      that truly stands out from the competition, you must ensure that it is properly designed and developed. Here are a
      few reasons why having a properly designed and developed website is so important:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Establish Credibility and Trust When visitors come to your website, you want them to trust that you are a
        credible business or organisation. A properly designed and developed website can help to build that trust. Your
        website should be easy to navigate, aesthetically pleasing, and should feature all of the necessary information
        and content that visitors need to know.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase Conversion Rates Your website is the perfect opportunity to convert visitors into customers. When the
        design and development of a website are done correctly, it can help to increase conversion rates by making it
        easier for visitors to find the information they need and take action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enhance User Experience Having a website that is properly designed and developed allows for a better user
        experience. Your website should be fast, intuitive, and enjoyable to use. If a website is not properly designed
        and developed, it can lead to frustration and confusion for visitors, which can hurt your business.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve SEO Search engine optimisation (SEO) is an important factor for any website. By having a website that is
        properly designed and developed, you can ensure that your website is optimised for search engines, making it
        easier for potential visitors to find you.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <p>
      According to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home" target="_blank"> <em>The World Bank</em> </a> well
      over 90% of individuals in the UK are internet users, the increase over the past 30 years can be seen in the
      graphic below;
    </p>

    <p>
      The chances are that is someone is looking for a service or product that you offer then they are looking if not
      solely online but certainly as part of their research.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the day, having a properly designed and developed website is essential for any business or
      organisation that wants to succeed in the digital age. A well-crafted website can draw in potential customers,
      build trust and credibility, and ultimately help your business or organisation to grow.
